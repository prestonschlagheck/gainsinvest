    "recommendations": [],
    "reasoning": "Based on the user's profile, they have a moderate risk tolerance (5/10), a medium time horizon, and a goal of balanced growth with openness to all sectors and moderate ESG priority (5/10). However, the available investment amount is $0, and there are no current holdings. Per the capital allocation rules, total BUY and HOLD amounts must equal available capital, which is $0, preventing any new investments or holds. No existing holdings require SELL or HOLD processing. If capital becomes available, a recommended balanced growth portfolio would include diversified ETFs (e.g., VTI for broad market exposure at 7-10% expected return), large-cap stocks (e.g., in technology or consumer sectors at 6-12% return), and possibly bonds for stability (2-6% return), avoiding crypto due to negative momentum in BTC. All recommendations would ensure positive expected returns and diversification, with no single asset exceeding 20% allocation.",
    "riskAssessment": "The user's moderate risk tolerance (5/10) aligns with a balanced growth strategy, emphasizing diversification to mitigate volatility. Current market trends show slight downward pressure in most indicators (e.g., SPY -0.05%, VTI -0.23%), suggesting moderate risk in equities. With $0 available, there is no immediate portfolio risk, but future investments should limit exposure to high-volatility assets like growth stocks to maintain balance.",
    "marketOutlook": "The market exhibits mixed signals with slight downward trends in SPY ($644.56, -0.05%), VTI ($316.92, -0.23%), GLD ($307.11, -0.68%), and TLT ($86.995, -0.77%), indicating caution in broad equities, gold, and bonds. QQQ ($580.49, +0.03%) shows slight upward momentum, favoring tech/growth sectors. BTC at $118,000 has negative momentum, so cryptocurrency is excluded. Overall sentiment is cautious with potential for balanced growth in diversified assets projecting 6-12% annual returns for stocks and 7-10% for ETFs, adjusted for current volatility.",
